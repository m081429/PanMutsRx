The users should have some basic bioinformatics and linux skills to use this Workflow. Users can run the workflow on a cluster[Tested on Open Grid Engine not tested on SGE and PBS] or on single machine (High memory > 40GB is required for one or more tools used in the workflow)

(i) First is to install the tools. So please run the "INSTALL_TOOLS.sh" script to install required tools (required example config file is provided in the "source_package/tool_install_config.txt") and output file (Workflow tool info file) is produced
Run time: few minutes
Space required: 4GB
(ii) As a second step,run the "PREPARE_REF_FILES.sh" script to prepare reference files 
input: Tool info file produced from tool install script
output: More parameters are added to the  Tool info file
Run Time: Several hours
Space required:130GB
(iii) example config files are provides
Cluster example: /sampleconfigfiles/sample_cluster_config/SomaticCaller_cluster.sh
Single machine run: /sampleconfigfiles/sample_singlemachine_config/SomaticCaller_singlemachine.sh
sample fastq files: /sampleconfigfiles/sample_fastq_files/
Number of samples: 1 simulated normal and tumor sample
Number of reads in the simulated fastq file:4 million reads pairs in each sample
Run time on cluster: few hours
space required to run this sample fastq file:2 GB of output files (more space is required to run all the jobs)
